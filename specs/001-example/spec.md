# textstat — worked-example intake spec

> **Worked example.** This directory is a complete ratified intake packet — the artifact set the Forge
> produces between "fuzzy objective" and "minted beads": `spec.md` (this file), `understanding.md` (the
> Gate-A projection a human ratified), `restatement.md` (the reviewer consensus log), and
> `crosswalk.json` (local `T0NN` ids → minted `fx-xxx` bead ids, written by `intake.sh convert`). The
> lifecycle it walked: `intake.sh start` → one clarify round (then budget exhausted → flagged
> assumptions) → Gate-A restatement (one DISAGREE, reconciled) → `intake.sh ratify` → `intake.sh
> convert` minted four beads → `run-task` built each in an isolated worktree → `finish` opened a PR per
> task → a human merged → `reconcile` closed the beads. The target repo `example-target` matches the
> entry in `harness/repos.config.example`; every id below is an example, nothing here is live.

## Header

- **Objective:** Add a small text-statistics utility (`textstat`) to `example-target`: line, word, and
  character counts for UTF-8 text, usable on a file operand and in shell pipelines.
- **Target Repo(s):** `example-target`
- **Mode:** interactive
- **Status:** approved

---

## User Scenarios

### US1 (P1) — Count a file's lines, words, and characters

As a developer in `example-target`, I want a `textstat` command that reports line, word, and character
counts for a text file, so that I can check fixture and corpus sizes without leaving the repo's
toolchain.

- **Independent Test:** Run `textstat` on a checked-in fixture file; the three reported counts equal the
  fixture's reference counts.
- **Acceptance Scenarios:**
  1. **Given** a UTF-8 file with known content, **When** `textstat <file>` runs, **Then** it prints the
     file's line, word, and character counts and exits 0.
  2. **Given** a path that does not exist, **When** `textstat <path>` runs, **Then** it exits non-zero
     with a one-line diagnostic naming the path and prints no counts.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Empty file → counts are `0 0 0`, exit 0 (valid input, not an error — see Assumptions).
  - A final line without a trailing newline still counts as a line.
  - Input that is not valid UTF-8 → rejected loudly per FR-002.

### US2 (P2) — Compose in shell pipelines

As a developer, I want `textstat` to read standard input when no file operand is given, so that I can
pipe generated text through it.

- **Independent Test:** Piping known content produces the same counts as the file-operand form for
  identical content.
- **Acceptance Scenarios:**
  1. **Given** content on stdin and no file operand, **When** `textstat` runs, **Then** the counts equal
     the file-operand counts for the same bytes.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - stdin closed with no data → `0 0 0`, exit 0.

### US3 (P3) — Machine-readable output

As a script author, I want `textstat --json`, so that downstream tooling parses counts without scraping
human-oriented text.

- **Independent Test:** `--json` output parses as a JSON object with the three integer fields.
- **Acceptance Scenarios:**
  1. **Given** a valid input, **When** `textstat --json` runs, **Then** stdout is exactly one JSON
     object `{"lines": n, "words": n, "chars": n}`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Error under `--json` → diagnostic on stderr, no partial JSON on stdout (FR-002 applies unchanged).

---

## Requirements

- **FR-001:** System **MUST** report the line, word, and character counts of a UTF-8 text file named by
  a single file operand. _(US1)_
- **FR-002:** System **MUST** exit non-zero with a one-line diagnostic naming the input when the operand
  is missing, unreadable, or not valid UTF-8 — and **MUST NOT** print partial counts. _(US1)_
- **FR-003:** System **MUST** read standard input to EOF when invoked without a file operand, and report
  the same counts the file form would for identical content. _(US2)_
- **FR-004:** System **MUST**, under `--json`, emit exactly one JSON object with integer fields `lines`,
  `words`, `chars` — and nothing else — on stdout. _(US3)_
- **FR-005:** System **MUST** count characters as Unicode code points — not bytes, not grapheme
  clusters. See `[ASSUMED · functional-correctness · confidence:med]` in Assumptions. _(US1)_
- **FR-006:** System **MUST** count words as maximal runs of non-whitespace characters (resolved in
  Clarifications Round 1). _(US1)_
- **FR-007:** System **SHOULD** process inputs of at least 100 MB without memory growth proportional to
  input size. _(US1)_

---

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001:** 100% of the counting fixtures (ASCII, multi-byte UTF-8, empty, no-trailing-newline) report
  counts equal to their reference values; 0 mismatches.
- **SC-002:** For every error fixture (missing path, unreadable path, invalid UTF-8), the exit code is
  non-zero, exactly one diagnostic line names the input, and stdout carries no counts.
- **SC-003:** For identical content, the stdin form and the file-operand form report identical counts on
  100% of fixtures.
- **SC-004:** 100% of `--json` outputs parse as JSON and carry the same three counts as the plain form
  for the same input.

---

## Assumptions

- `[ASSUMED · functional-correctness · confidence:med]` "Characters" are Unicode code points — not
  bytes, not grapheme clusters. **Chosen because** code points are deterministic across platforms and
  need no segmentation tables. **Discarded:** byte counts (encoding-dependent, surprising for UTF-8);
  grapheme clusters (require Unicode segmentation data — a dependency this intake refuses).
  _(propagated to FR-005, SC-001)_ — this ambiguity surfaced after the intake's one-round clarify
  budget (`INTAKE_CLARIFY_ROUNDS=1`) was spent, so it routed here as a flagged assumption for the
  ratify gate instead of a second question (the budget bounds questions, never coverage — route, never
  drop).
- `[ASSUMED · dependency-supply-chain · confidence:med]` The utility uses the language standard library
  only — zero new runtime dependencies. **Chosen because** counting needs no third-party capability and
  every new dependency widens the supply-chain surface. **Discarded:** a Unicode segmentation library
  (only needed for grapheme counting, which was not chosen). _(propagated to T001 scope; see Deferrals)_
- Empty input is valid input: counts are `0 0 0` and the exit code is 0. Deliberate, no clarification
  round needed. _(propagated to US1/US2 Edge Cases)_
- `[VAULT-PROPOSAL · cli-conventions]` Every CLI in `example-target` reads stdin when invoked without a
  file operand. **Bead draft:** title "vault: record the stdin-fallback CLI convention" — body: FR-003's
  behaviour generalized to a repo-wide convention, so future intakes inherit it instead of re-clarifying
  it. (The Architect never writes the vault; a human mints this bead.)

---

## Deferrals / Out of scope

The **coverage ledger**: every canonical category from `harness/intake-categories.json` appears exactly
once with one of the three legal dispositions (**covered by FR-NNN**, **deliberately N/A — reason**, or
**surfaced — ref**), so an omission is a ratifiable decision, not an invisible gap. Breadth is cheap —
most categories are `deliberately N/A` for a change this small.

> **Catastrophic-tier note (G3):** the following `by-default` categories were consciously de-escalated
> for this intake by a human via `intake.sh risk --remove <id>` — a stateless, offline, read-only text
> utility gives them no surface, so their `deliberately N/A` dispositions below are legal at the ratify
> floor: `data-migration-schema-evolution`, `ml-training-data-provenance`, `concurrency-consistency`, `authorization-access-control`, `confidentiality`, `data-privacy`, `identity-auth-session`, `integrity`, `resistance`, `secrets-key-management`, `tenancy-isolation`, `ml-output-safety-guardrails`, `backup-disaster-recovery`, `data-residency-sovereignty`, `data-retention-lifecycle`, `library-licensing-attribution`, `ml-bias-fairness`, `regulatory-compliance-consent`.

## Clarifications

### Round 1 — 2026-01-15

- **Q (functional-scope-behaviour):** What is a "word" — a whitespace-delimited run, or a locale-aware
  token? → **A:** A maximal run of non-whitespace characters; Unicode whitespace delimits. _(propagated
  to FR-006, SC-001)_
- **Q (cli-stdio-piping-contract):** With no file operand, should the tool error out or read stdin? →
  **A:** Read stdin to EOF — the tool must compose in pipelines. _(propagated to FR-003, US2)_
- **Q (implementation-requirements):** Standalone script, or part of the target repo's toolchain? →
  **A:** Inside `example-target`'s existing language and test gate; no new toolchain. _(propagated to
  the Task Breakdown `scope` and `dod_tests`)_

## Task Breakdown

Four tasks, one PR each. `T001` is the counting core; the other three fan out from it and can build in
parallel once it merges. The JSON between the sentinels is the machine contract `intake.sh convert`
reads to mint beads — the converter validated it (all nine invariants), minted `fx-` beads in
topological order, and recorded the mapping in `crosswalk.json` beside this spec.
